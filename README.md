# Mapping Tables to Objects

## Overview
In this lesson, we'll cover the basics of reading from a database table that is mapped to a Ruby object.

## Objectives
1. Build methods that read from a database table.
2. Build a `Song.all` class method that returns all songs from the database.
3. Build a `Song.find_by_name` class method that accepts one argument, a name, searches the database for a song with that name, and returns the matching song entry if one is found.
4. Convert what the database gives you into a Ruby object.

Our Ruby program gets most interesting when we add data. To do this, we use a database. When we want our Ruby program to store things, we send them off to a database. When we want to retrieve those things, we ask the database to send them back to our program. This works very well, but there is one small problem to overcome â€“ our Ruby program and the database don't speak the same language.

Ruby understands objects. The database understands raw data.

We don't store Ruby objects in the database, and we don't get Ruby objects back from the database. We store raw data describing a given Ruby object in a table row, and, when we want to reconstruct a Ruby object from the stored data, we select that same row in the table.

When we query the database, it is up to us to write the code that takes that data and turns it back into an instance of the appropriate class. We, the programmers, will be responsible for translating the raw data that the database sends into Ruby objects that are instances of a particular class.

## Example
Let's use our song domain as an example. Imagine we have a `Song` class that is responsible for making songs. Every song will come with two attributes, a `title` and a `length`. We could make a bunch of new songs, but first we want to look at all the songs that have already been created.

Imagine we have a database with 1 million songs. We need to build three methods to access all of those songs and convert them to Ruby objects.

## `.new_from_db`
The first thing we need to do is convert what the database gives us into a Ruby object. We will use this method to create all the Ruby objects in our next two methods.

The first thing to know is that the database, SQLite in our case, will return an array of data for each row. For example, a row for Michael Jackson's "Thriller" (356 seconds long) that has a db id of 1 would look like this: `[1, "Thriller", 356]`.

```ruby
def self.new_from_db(row)
  new_song = self.new  # self.new is the same as running Song.new
  new_song.id = row[0]
  new_song.name =  row[1]
  new_song.length = row[2]
  new_song  # return the newly created instance
end
```

## `Song.all` 
Now we can start writing our methods to retrieve the data. To return all the songs in the database we need to execute the following SQL query: `SELECT * FROM songs`. Let's store that in a variable called `sql` using a heredoc (`<<-`) since our string will go onto multiple lines:
```ruby
sql = <<-SQL
  SELECT *
  FROM songs
SQL
```

Next, we will make a call to our database using `DB[:conn]`. This `DB` hash is located in the `config/environment.rb` file: `DB = {:conn => SQLite3::Database.new("db/songs.db")}`. Notice that the value of the hash is actually a new instance of the `SQLite3::Database` class. This is how we will connect to our database. Our database instance responds to a method called `execute` that accepts raw SQL as a string. Let's pass in that SQL we stored above:
```ruby
class Song
  def self.all
    sql = <<-SQL
      SELECT *
      FROM songs
    SQL
    
    DB[:conn].execute(sql)
  end
end
```

This will return an array of rows from the database that match our query. Now, all we have to do is iterate over each row and use the `self.new_from_db` method to create a new Ruby object for each row:
```ruby
class Song
  def self.all
    sql = <<-SQL
      SELECT *
      FROM songs
    SQL
    
    DB[:conn].execute(sql).map do |row|
      self.new_from_db(row)
    end
  end
end
```

## `Song.find_by_name`
This one is similar to `Song.all` with the small exception being that we have to include a name in our SQL statement. To do this, we use a question mark where we want the `name` parameter to be passed in, and we include `name` as the second argument to the `execute` method:
```ruby
class Song
  def self.find_by_name(name)
    sql = <<-SQL
      SELECT *
      FROM songs
      WHERE name = ?
      LIMIT 1
    SQL

    DB[:conn].execute(sql, name).map do |row|
      self.new_from_db(row)
    end.first
  end
end
```

Don't be freaked out by that `.first` method chained to the end of the `DB[:conn].execute(sql, name).map` block. The return value of the `.map` method is an array, and we're simply grabbing the `.first` element from the returned array. Chaining is cool!
